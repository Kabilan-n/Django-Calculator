# Django-Calculator

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

Here I have made a Calculator app using Django in python. In This i have also adjusted the website for all the screen sizes, different devices also. I think this is one of the best way to start with Web developement using Django.
